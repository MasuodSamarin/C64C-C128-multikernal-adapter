- move the PIC half the pin pitch (1.27mm) towards the top (normal socket's middle bar wouldn't need to be cut anymore)
- silkscreen font is too small, use larger font and move some text to the other side (DirtyPCBs supports it despite
  stating otherwise), smallest font should be like the current font at the top of the board, everything else is unreadable
- there is plenty of space inside C64C/C128 to expand the board a bit vertically, currently the pin headers at the bottom
  are way too close to the EPROM and expanding the board would allow the font at the bottom to be larger
